:section: 7
:chapter: 40
:content: "* 1\\. Except where the context otherwise requires, throughout the nomenclature
  the expression 'rubber' means the following products, whether or not vulcanised
  or hard: natural rubber, balata, gutta-percha, guayule, chicle and similar natural
  gums, synthetic rubber, factice derived from oils, and such substances reclaimed.\r\n*
  2\\. This chapter does not cover:\r\n  * (a) goods of Section XI (textiles and textile
  articles);\r\n  * (b) footwear or parts thereof of Chapter 64;\r\n  * (c) headgear
  or parts thereof (including bathing caps) of Chapter 65;\r\n  * (d) mechanical or
  electrical appliances or parts thereof of Section XVI (including electrical goods
  of all kinds), of hard rubber;\r\n  * (e) articles of Chapter 90, 92, 94 or 96;
  or\r\n  * (f) articles of Chapter 95 (other than sports gloves, mittens and mitts
  and articles of headings 4011 to 4013).\r\n* 3\\. In headings 4001 to 4003 and 4005,
  the expression 'primary forms' applies only to the following forms:\r\n  * (a) liquids
  and pastes (including latex, whether or not pre-vulcanised, and other dispersions
  and solutions);\r\n  * (b) blocks of irregular shape, lumps, bales, powders, granules,
  crumbs and similar bulk forms.\r\n* 4\\. In Note 1 to this chapter and in heading
  4002, the expression 'synthetic rubber' applies to:\r\n  * (a) unsaturated synthetic
  substances which can be irreversibly transformed by vulcanisation with sulphur into
  non-thermoplastic substances which, at a temperature between 18C and 29C, will not
  break on being extended to three times their original length and will return, after
  being extended to twice their original length, within a period of five minutes,
  to a length not greater than one and a half times their original length. For the
  purposes of this test, substances necessary for the cross-linking, such as vulcanising
  activators or accelerators, may be added; the presence of substances as provided
  for by Note 5 (b) (2) and (3) is also permitted. However, the presence of any substances
  not necessary for the cross-linking, such as extenders, plasticisers and fillers,
  is not permitted;\r\n  * (b) thioplasts (TM); and\r\n  * (c) natural rubber modified
  by grafting or mixing with plastics, depolymerised natural rubber, mixtures of unsaturated
  synthetic substances with saturated synthetic high polymers provided that all the
  above-mentioned products comply with the requirements concerning vulcanisation,
  elongation and recovery in (a) above.\r\n* 5\\. (A) Headings 4001 and 4002 do not
  apply to any rubber or mixture of rubbers which has been compounded, before or after
  coagulation, with:\r\n  * (1) vulcanising agents, accelerators, retarders or activators
  (other than those added for the preparation of pre-vulcanised rubber latex);\r\n
  \ * (2) pigments or other colouring matter, other than those added solely for the
  purpose of identification;\r\n  * (3) plasticisers or extenders (except mineral
  oil in the case of oil-extended rubber), fillers, reinforcing agents, organic solvents
  or any other substances, except those permitted under (B);\r\n* (B) The presence
  of the following substances in any rubber or mixture of rubbers shall not affect
  its classification in heading 4001 or 4002, as the case may be, provided that such
  rubber or mixture of rubbers retains its essential character as a raw material:\r\n
  \ * (1) emulsifiers or anti-tack agents;\r\n  * (2) small amounts of breakdown products
  of emulsifiers;\r\n  * (3) very small amounts of the following: heat-sensitive agents
  (generally, for obtaining thermosensitive rubber latexes), cationic surface-active
  agents (generally, for obtaining electropositive rubber latexes), antioxidants,
  coagulants, crumbling agents, freeze-resisting agents, peptisers, preservatives,
  stabilisers, viscosity-control agents, or similar special-purpose additives.\r\n*
  6\\. For the purposes of heading 4004, the expression 'waste, parings and scrap'
  means rubber waste, parings and scrap from the manufacture or working of rubber
  and rubber goods definitely not usable as such because of cutting-up, wear or other
  reasons.\r\n* 7\\. Thread wholly of vulcanised rubber, of which any cross-sectional
  dimension exceeds 5mm, is to be classified as strip, rods or profile shapes, of
  heading 4008.\r\n* 8\\. Heading 4010 includes conveyor or transmission belts or
  belting of textile fabric impregnated, coated, covered or laminated with rubber
  or made from textile yarn or cord impregnated, coated, covered or sheathed with
  rubber.\r\n* 9\\. In headings 4001, 4002, 4003, 4005 and 4008, the expression 'plates',
  'sheets' and 'strip' apply only to plates, sheets and strip and to blocks of regular
  geometric shape, uncut or simply cut to rectangular (including square) shape, whether
  or not having the character of articles and whether or not printed or otherwise
  surface-worked, but not otherwise cut to shape or further worked.\r\n* In heading
  4008 the expressions 'rods' and 'profile shapes' apply only to such products, whether
  or not cut to length or surface-worked but not otherwise worked.\r\n\r\n## Additional
  note ##\r\n\r\nWhere the woven, knitted or crocheted fabrics, felt or nonwovens
  are present merely for reinforcing purposes, gloves, mittens or mitts impregnated,
  coated or covered with cellular rubber belong to Chapter 40, even if they are:\r\n*
  - made up from woven, knitted or crocheted fabrics (other than those of heading
  5906), felt or nonwovens impregnated, coated or covered with cellular rubber, or\r\n*
  - made up from unimpregnated, uncoated or uncovered woven, knitted or crocheted
  fabrics, felt or nonwovens and subsequently impregnated, coated or covered with
  cellular rubber.\r\n(Note 3(c) to Chapter 56 and note 4, last paragraph, to Chapter
  59).\r\n"
