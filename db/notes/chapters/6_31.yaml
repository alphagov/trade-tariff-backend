  \   * (7) calcium cyanamide, whether or not pure or treated with oil;\r\n    * (8)
  urea, whether or not pure;\r\n    * (b) fertilisers consisting of any of the goods
  described in (a) above mixed together;\r\n    * (c) fertilisers consisting of ammonium
  chloride or of any of the goods described in (a) or (b) above mixed with chalk,

  \   * (3) superphosphates (single, double or triple);\r\n    * (4) calcium hydrogenorthophosphate
  containing not less than 0.2% by weight of fluorine calculated on the dry anhydrous
  product;\r\n    * (b) fertilisers consisting of any of the goods described in (a)
  above mixed together, but with no account being taken of the fluorine content limit;\r\n
  \   * (c) fertilisers consisting of any of the goods described in (a) or (b) above,
  but with no account being taken of the fluorine content limit, mixed with chalk,
  gypsum or other inorganic non-fertilising substances.\r\n* 4\\. Heading 3104 applies
  only to the following goods, provided that they are not put up in the forms or packages
  described in heading 3105:\r\n  * (a) goods which answer to one or other of the
  descriptions given below:\r\n    * (1) crude natural potassium salts (for example,
  carnallite, kainite and sylvite);\r\n    * (2) potassium chloride, whether or not
  pure, except as provided in note 1(c) above;\r\n    * (3) potassium sulphate, whether
  or not pure;\r\n    * (4) magnesium potassium sulphate, whether or not pure;\r\n
  \ * (b) fertilisers consisting of any of the goods described in (a) above mixed
  together.\r\n* 5\\. Ammonium dihydrogenorthophosphate (monoammonium phosphate) and
  diammonium hydrogenorthophosphate (diammonium phosphate), whether or not pure, and
  intermixtures thereof, are to be classified in heading 3105.\r\n* 6\\. For the purposes
  of heading 3105, the term `other fertilisers' applies only to products of a kind
