:content: "* 1\\. This chapter does not cover:\r\n  * (a) mammals of heading 0106;\r\n
  \ * (b) meat of mammals of heading 0106 (heading 0208 or 0210);\r\n  * (c) fish
  (including livers and roes thereof) or crustaceans, molluscs or other aquatic invertebrates,
  dead and unfit or unsuitable for human consumption by reason of either their species
  or their condition (Chapter 5); flours, meals or pellets of fish or of crustaceans,
  molluscs or other aquatic invertebrates, unfit for human consumption (heading 2301);
  or\r\n  * (d) caviar or caviar substitutes prepared from fish eggs (heading 1604).\r\n*
  2\\. In this chapter the term `pellets' means products which have been agglomerated
  either directly by compression or by the addition of a small quantity of binder.\r\n\r\n##
  Additional notes ## \r\n\r\n* 1\\. For the purposes of subheadings 03053211 and
  03053219, cod fillets (Gadus morhua, Gadus ogac, Gadus macrocephalus) having a total
  salt content by weight of 12% or more which are fit for human consumption without
  further industrial processing, are considered to be salted fish. \r\n\r\nHowever,
  frozen cod fillets which have a total salt content by weight of less than 12% are
  to be classified under subheadings 03047110 and 03047190 in so far as the actual
  and lasting preservation depends essentially upon freezing.\r\n\r\n* 2\\. For the
  purposes of the CN subheadings referred to in the third subparagraph, the term fillets
  includes loins, i.e. the strips of meat constituting the upper or lower, right or
  left, side of a fish insofar as the head, guts, fins (dorsal, anal, caudal, ventral,
  pectoral) and bones (spinal column or main backbone, ventral or costal bones, branchial
  bone or stapes, etc.) have been removed.\r\n\r\nThe classification of such products
  as fillets is unaffected by cutting them into pieces, provided that these pieces
  can be identified as having been obtained from fillets.\r\n\r\nThe provisions of
  the first two subparagraphs apply to the following fish:\r\n\r\n  * (a) tuna (of
  the genus Thunnus) of CN subheadings 0304 49 90 and 0304 87 00,\r\n \r\n  * (b)
  swordfish (Xiphias gladius) of CN subheadings 0304 45 00 and 0304 84 00,\r\n \r\n
  \ * (c) marlin, sailfish and spearfish (of the family Istiophoridae) of CN subheadings
  0304 49 90 and 0304 89 90,\r\n \r\n  * (d) oceanic sharks (Hexanchus griseus; Cetorhinus
  maximus; family Alopiidae; Rhincodon typus; family Carcharhinidae; family Sphyrnidae;
  family Isuridae) of CN subheadings 0304 49 90 and 0304 89 59\r\n\r\n\r\n"
