:content: "* 1\\. Throughout the nomenclature, the term 'man-made fibres' means staple
  fibres and filaments of organic polymers produced by manufacturing processes, either:\r\n
  \ * (a) by polymerisation of organic monomers, to produce polymers such as polyamides,
  polyesters polyolefins or, polyurethanes, or by chemical modification of polymers
  produced by this process (for example, poly (vinyl alcohol) prepared by the hydrolysis
  of poly (vinyl acetate); or\r\n  * (b) by dissolution or chemical treatment of natural
  organic polymers (for example, cellulose) to produce polymers such as cuprammonium
  rayan (cupro) or viscose rayan, or by chemical modification of natural organic polymers
  (for example, cellulose, casein, and other proteins or alginic acid) to produce
  polymers such as cellulose acetate or alginates.\r\n  * The terms 'synthetic' and
  'artificial', used in relation to fibres, mean: synthetic: fibres as defined at
  (a); artificial: fibres as defined at (b). Strip and the like of heading 5404 or
  5405 are not considered to be man-made fibres.\r\n  * The terms 'man-made', 'synthetic'
  and 'artificial' shall have the same meanings when used in relation to 'textile
  materials'.\r\n* 2\\. Headings 5402 and 5403 do not apply to synthetic or artificial
  filament tow of Chapter 55.\r\n"
