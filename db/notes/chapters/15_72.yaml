  conforming to this definition are to be classified in heading 7304.\r\n* 2\\. Ferrous
  metals clad with another ferrous metal are to be classified as products of the ferrous
  metal predominating by weight.\r\n* 3\\. Iron or steel products obtained by electrolytic
  deposition, by pressure casting or by sintering are to be classified, according
  to their form, their composition and their appearance, in the headings of this Chapter
  appropriate to similar hot-rolled products.\r\n\r\n## Subheading notes ##\r\n\r\n*
  1\\. In this chapter, the following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned
  to them:\r\n  * (a) alloy pig iron\r\n    * Pig iron containing, by weight, one
  or more of the following elements in the specified proportions:\r\n      * \\- more
  than 0.2% of chromium\r\n      * \\- more than 0.3% of copper\r\n      * \\- more
  than 0.3% of nickel\r\n      * \\- more than 0.1% of any of the following elements:
  aluminium, molybdenum, titanium, tungsten (wolfram), vanadium.\r\n  * (b) non-alloy
  free-cutting steel\r\n    * Non-alloy steel containing, by weight, one or more of
  the following elements in the specified proportions:\r\n      * \\- 0.08% or more
  of sulphur\r\n      * \\- 0.1% or more of lead\r\n      * \\- more than 0.05% of

  of bismuth.\r\n  * (c) silicon-electrical steel\r\n    * Alloy steels containing
  by weight at least 0.6% but not more than 6% of silicon and not more than 0.08%
  of carbon. They may also contain by weight not more than 1% of aluminium but no
  other element in a proportion that would give the steel the characteristics of another
  alloy steel.\r\n  * (d) high speed steel\r\n    * Alloy steels containing, with
  or without other elements, at least two of the three elements molybdenum, tungsten
  and vanadium with a combined content by weight of 7% or more, 0.6% or more of carbon
  and 3 to 6% of chromium.\r\n  * (e) silico-manganese steel\r\n    * Alloy steels
  containing by weight:\r\n      * \\- not more than 0.7% of carbon,\r\n      * \\-
  0.5% or more but not more than 1.9% of manganese, and\r\n      * \\- 0.6% or more
  but not more than 2.3% of silicon, but no other element in a proportion that would
  give the steel the characteristics of another alloy steel.\r\n* 2\\. For the classification
  of ferro-alloys in the subheadings of heading 7202 the following rule should be
  observed:\r\n* A ferro-alloy is considered as binary and classified under the relevant
  subheading (if it exists) if only one of the alloy elements exceeds the minimum
  percentage laid down in note 1(c) to this Chapter; by analogy, it is considered
  respectively as ternary or quaternary if two or three alloy elements exceed the
  minimum percentage.\r\n* For the application of this rule, the unspecified 'other
  elements' referred to in note 1(c) to this Chapter must each exceed 10% by weight.\r\n\r\n##
