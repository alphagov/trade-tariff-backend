:content: "* 1\\. In this chapter, the following expressions have the meanings hereby
  assigned to them:\r\n  * (a) Refined copper:\r\n    * Metal containing at least
  99.85% by weight of copper; or\r\n    * Metal containing at least 97.5% by weight
  of copper, provided that the content by weight of any other element does not exceed
  the limit specified in the following table:\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr><th

  (b) Copper alloys:\r\n    * Metallic substances other than unrefined copper in which
  copper predominates by weight over each of the other elements, provided that:\r\n
  \     * (1) the content by weight of at least one of the other elements is greater
  than the limit specified in the foregoing table; or\r\n      * (2) the total content
  by weight of such other elements exceeds 2.5%\r\n  * (c) Master alloys:\r\n    *
  Alloys containing with other elements more than 10% by weight of copper, not usefully
  malleable and commonly used as an additive in the manufacture of other alloys or
  as de-oxidants, de-sulphurising agents or for similar uses in the metallurgy of
  non-ferrous metals. However, copper phosphide (phosphor copper) containing more
  than 15% by weight of phosphorus falls in heading 2848.\r\n  * (d) Bars and rods:\r\n
  \   * rolled, extruded, drawn or forged products, not in coils, which have a uniform
  solid cross-section along their whole length in the shape of circles, ovals, rectangles
  (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons (including
  'flattened circles' and 'modified rectangles', of which two opposite sides are convex
  arcs, the other two sides being straight, of equal length and parallel). Products
  with a rectangular (including square), triangular or polygonal cross-section may
  have corners rounded along their whole length. The thickness of such products which
  have a rectangular (including 'modified rectangular') cross-section exceeds one-tenth
  of the width. The expression also covers cast or sintered products, of the same
  forms and dimensions, which have been subsequently worked after production (otherwise
  than by simple trimming or de-scaling), provided that they have not thereby assumed
  the character of articles or products of other headings.\r\n    * Wire-bars and
  billets with their ends tapered or otherwise worked simply to facilitate their entry
  into machines for converting them into, for example, drawing stock (wire-rod) or
  tubes, are however to be taken to be unwrought copper of heading 7403.\r\n  * (e)
  Profiles:\r\n    * Rolled, extruded, drawn, forged or formed products, coiled or
  not, of a uniform cross-section along their whole length, which do not conform to
  any of the definitions of bars, rods, wire, plates, sheets, strip, foil, tubes or
  pipes. The expression also covers cast or sintered products, of the same forms,
  which have been subsequently worked after production (otherwise than by simple trimming
  or de-scaling), provided that they have not thereby assumed the character of articles
  or products of other headings.\r\n  * (f) Wire:\r\n    * Rolled, extruded or drawn
  products, in coils, which have a uniform solid cross-section along their whole length
  in the shape of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral triangles
  or regular convex polygons (including 'flattened circles' and 'modified rectangles',
  of which two opposite sides are convex arcs, the other two sides being straight,
  of equal length and parallel). Products with a rectangular (including square), triangular
  or polygonal cross-section may have corners rounded along their whole length. The
  thickness of such products which have a rectangular (including 'modified rectangular')
  cross-section exceeds one-tenth of the width.\r\n  * (g) Plates, sheets, strip and
  foil:\r\n    * Flat-surfaced products (other than the unwrought products of heading
  7403), coiled or not, of solid rectangular (other than square) cross-section with
  or without rounded corners (including 'modified rectangles' of which two opposite
  sides are convex arcs, the other two sides being straight, of equal length and parallel)
  of a uniform thickness, which are:\r\n      * \\- of rectangular (including square)
  shape with a thickness not exceeding one-tenth of the width,\r\n      * \\- of a
  shape other than rectangular or square, of any size, provided that they do not assume
  the character of articles or products of other headings.\r\n    * Headings 7409
  and 7410 apply, inter alia, to plates, sheets, strip and foil with patterns (for
  example, grooves, ribs, chequers, tears, buttons, lozenges) and to such products
  which have been perforated, corrugated, polished or coated, provided that they do
  not thereby assume the character of articles or products of other headings.\r\n
  \ * (h) Tubes and pipes:\r\n    * Hollow products, coiled or not, which have a uniform
  cross-section with only one enclosed void along their whole length in the shape
  of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular
  convex polygons, and which have a uniform wall thickness. Products with a rectangular
  (including square), equilateral triangular or regular convex polygonal cross-section,
  which may have corners rounded along their whole length, are also to be taken to
  be tubes and pipes provided the inner and outer cross-sections are concentric and
  have the same form and orientation. Tubes and pipes of the foregoing cross-sections
  may be polished, coated, bent, threaded, drilled, waisted, expanded, cone-shaped
  or fitted with flanges, collars or rings.\r\n\r\n## Subheading note ##\r\n\r\n*
  1\\. In this chapter, the following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned
  to them:\r\n  * (a) Copper-zinc base alloys (brasses):\r\n    * Alloys of copper
  and zinc, with or without other elements. When other elements are present:\r\n      *
  \\- zinc predominates by weight over each of such other elements,\r\n      * \\-
  any nickel content by weight is less than 5% (see copper-nickel-zinc alloys (nickel
  silvers)), and\r\n      * \\- any tin content by weight is less than 3% (see copper-tin
  alloys (bronzes)).\r\n  * (b) Copper-tin base alloys (bronzes):\r\n    * Alloys
  of copper and tin, with or without other elements. When other elements are present,
  tin predominates by weight over each of such other elements, except that when the
  tin content is 3% or more the zinc content by weight may exceed that of tin but
  must be less than 10%.\r\n  * (c) Copper-nickel-zinc base alloys (nickel silvers):\r\n
  \   * Alloys of copper, nickel and zinc, with or without other elements. The nickel
  content is 5% or more by weight (see copper-zinc alloys (brasses)).\r\n  * (d) Copper-nickel
  base alloys:\r\n    * Alloys of copper and nickel, with or without other elements
  but in any case containing by weight not more than 1% of zinc. When other elements
  are present, nickel predominates by weight over each of such other elements."
