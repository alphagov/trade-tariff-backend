  all articles consisting wholly or partly:\r\n  * (a) of natural or cultured pearls
  or of precious or \r\nsemi-precious stones (natural, synthetic or reconstructed),
  or\r\n  * (b) of precious metal or of metal clad with precious metal,\r\n  * are
  to be classified in this chapter.\r\n* 2\\. (A) Headings 7113, 7114 and 7115 do
  not cover articles in which precious metal or metal clad with precious metal is
  present as minor constituents only, such as minor fittings or minor ornamentation
  (for example, monograms, ferrules and rims), and paragraph (b) of the foregoing
  note does not apply to such articles.\r\n* (B) Heading 7116 does not cover articles
  containing precious metal or metal clad with precious metal (other than as minor
  constituents).\r\n* 3\\. This chapter does not cover:\r\n  * (a) amalgams of precious
  metal, or colloidal precious metal (heading 2843);\r\n  * (b) sterile surgical suture
  materials, dental fillings or other goods of Chapter 30;\r\n  * (c) goods of Chapter
  32 (for example, lustres);\r\n  * (d) supported catalysts (heading 3815);\r\n  *
  (e) articles of heading 4202 or 4203 referred to in note 3(B) to Chapter 42;\r\n
  \ * (f) articles of heading 4303 or 4304;\r\n  * (g) goods of Section XI (textiles
  and textile articles);\r\n  * (h) footwear, headgear or other articles of Chapter

  \ * (k) abrasive goods of heading 6804 or 6805 or Chapter 82, containing dust or
  powder of precious or semi-precious stones (natural or synthetic); articles of Chapter
  82 with a working part of precious or semi-precious stones (natural, synthetic or
  reconstructed); machinery, mechanical appliances or electrical goods, or parts thereof,
  of Section XVI. However, articles and parts thereof, wholly of precious or semi-precious
  stones (natural, synthetic or reconstructed) remain classified in this Chapter,
  except unmounted worked sapphires and diamonds for styluses (heading 8522);\r\n
  \ * (l) articles of Chapter 90, 91 or 92 (scientific instruments, clocks and watches,

  the purposes of this chapter, any alloy (including a sintered mixture and an inter-metallic
  compound) containing precious metal is to be treated as an alloy of precious metal
  if any one precious metal constitutes as much as 2%, by weight, of the alloy. Alloys
  of precious metal are to be classified according to the following rules:\r\n  *
  (a) An alloy containing 2% or more, by weight, of platinum is to be treated as an
  alloy of platinum.\r\n  * (b) An alloy containing 2% or more, by weight, of gold
  but no platinum, or less than 2%, by weight, of platinum, is to be treated as an
  alloy of gold.\r\n  * (c) Other alloys containing 2% or more, by weight, of silver
  are to be treated as alloys of silver.\r\n* 6\\. Except where the context otherwise
  requires, any reference in the nomenclature to precious metal or to any particular
  precious metal includes a reference to alloys treated as alloys of precious metal
  or of the particular metal in accordance with the rules in note 5 above, but not
  to metal clad with precious metal or to base metal or non-metals plated with precious
  metal.\r\n* 7\\. Throughout the nomenclature, the expression 'metal clad with precious
  metal' means material made with a base of metal upon one or more surfaces of which
  there is affixed by soldering, brazing, welding, hot-rolling or similar mechanical
  means a covering of precious metal. Except where the context otherwise requires,
  the expression also covers base metal inlaid with precious metal.\r\n* 8\\. Subject
  to note 1(A) to Section VI, goods answering to a description in heading 7112 are
  to be classified in that heading and in no other heading of the nomenclature.\r\n*
  9\\. For the purposes of heading 7113, the expression 'articles of jewellery' means:\r\n

  dress-studs, religious or other medals and insignia); and\r\n  * (b) articles of
  personal use of a kind normally carried in the pocket, in the handbag or on the
  person (for example cigar or cigarette cases, snuff boxes, cachou or pill boxes,
  powder boxes, chain purses or prayer beads).\r\n* These articles may be combined
  or set, for example, with natural or cultured pearls, precious or semi-precious
  stones, synthetic or reconstructed precious or semi-precious stones, tortoise shell,
  mother-of-pearl, ivory, natural or reconstituted amber, jet or coral.\r\n* 10\\.
  For the purposes of heading 7114, the expression 'articles of goldsmiths' or silversmiths'
  wares' includes such articles as ornaments, tableware, toilet-ware, smokers' requisites

  21, 7110 31 and 7110 41, the expressions 'powder' and 'in powder form' mean products
  of which 90% or more by weight passes through a sieve having a mesh aperture of
  0.5 mm.\r\n* 2\\. Notwithstanding the provisions of chapter note 4(B), for the purposes
  of subheadings 7110 11 and 7110 19, the expression 'platinum' does not include iridium,
  osmium, palladium, rhodium or ruthenium.\r\n* 3\\. For the classification of alloys
  in subheadings of heading 7110, each alloy is to be classified with that metal,
  platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, osmium or ruthenium which predominates by
  weight over each other of these metals."
