:chapter: 28
:content: "* 1\\. Except where the context otherwise requires, the headings of this
  Chapter apply only to:\r\n  * (a) separate chemical elements and separate chemically
  defined compounds, whether or not containing impurities;\r\n  * (b) the products
  mentioned in (a) above dissolved in water;\r\n  * (c) the products mentioned in
  (a) above dissolved in other solvents provided that the solution constitutes a normal
  and necessary method of putting up these products adopted solely for reasons of
  safety or for transport and that the solvent does not render the product particularly
  suitable for specific use rather than for general use;\r\n  * (d) the products mentioned
  in (a), (b) or (c) above with an added stabiliser (including an anti-caking agent)
  necessary for their preservation or transport;\r\n  * (e) the products mentioned
  in (a), (b), (c) or (d) above with an added anti-dusting agent or a colouring substance
  added to facilitate their identification or for safety reasons, provided that the
  additions do not render the product particularly suitable for specific use rather
  than for general use.\r\n* 2\\. In addition to dithionites and sulphoxylates, stabilised
  with organic substances (heading 2831), carbonates and peroxocarbonates of inorganic
  bases (heading 2836), cyanides, cyanide oxides and complex cyanides of inorganic
  bases (heading 2837), fulminates, cyanates and thiocyanates, of inorganic bases
  (heading 2842), organic products included in headings 2843 to 2846 and 2852 and
  carbides (heading 2849), only the following compounds of carbon are to be classified
  in this chapter:\r\n  * (a) oxides of carbon, hydrogen cyanide and fulminic, isocyanic,
  thiocyanic and other simple or complex cyanogen acids (heading 2811);\r\n  * (b)
  halide oxides of carbon (heading 2812);\r\n  * (c) carbon disulphide (heading 2813);\r\n
  \ * (d) thiocarbonates, selenocarbonates, tellurocarbonates, selenocyanates, tellurocyanates,
  tetrathiocyanatodiamminochromates (reineckates) and other complex cyanates, of inorganic
  bases (heading 2842);\r\n  * (e) hydrogen peroxide, solidified with urea (heading
  2847), carbon oxysulphide, thiocarbonyl halides, cyanogen, cyanogen halides and
  cyanamide and its metal derivates (heading 2853) other than calcium cyanamide, whether
  or not pure (Chapter 31).\r\n* 3\\. Subject to the provisions of Note 1 to Section
  VI, this Chapter does not cover:\r\n  * (a) sodium chloride or magnesium oxide,
  whether or not pure, or other products of Section V;\r\n  * (b) organo-inorganic
  compounds other than those mentioned in note 2 above;\r\n  * (c) products mentioned
  in note 2, 3, 4 or 5 to Chapter 31;\r\n  * (d) inorganic products of a kind used
  as luminophores, of heading 3206; glass frit and other glass in the form of powder,
  granules or flakes, of heading 3207;\r\n  * (e) artificial graphite (heading 3801);
  products put up as charges for fire-extinguishers or put up in fire-extinguishing
  grenades, of heading 3813; ink removers put up in packings for retail sale, of heading
  3824; cultured crystals (other than optical elements) weighing not less than 2.5g
  each, of the halides of the alkali or alkaline-earth metals, of heading 3824;\r\n
  \ * (f) precious or semi-precious stones (natural, synthetic or reconstructed) or
  dust or powder of such stones (headings 7102 to 7105), or precious-metals or precious
  metal alloys of Chapter 71;\r\n  * (g) the metals, whether or not pure, metal alloys
  or cermets, including sintered metal carbides (metal carbides sintered with a metal),
  of Section XV; or\r\n  * (h) optical elements, for example, of the halides of the
  alkali or alkaline-earth metals (heading 9001).\r\n* 4\\. Chemically defined complex
  acids consisting of a non-metal acid of sub-Chapter II and a metal acid of sub-Chapter
  IV are to be classified in heading 2811.\r\n* 5\\. Headings 2826 to 2842 apply only
  to metal or ammonium salts or peroxysalts.\r\n* Except where the context otherwise
  requires, double or complex salts are to be classified in heading 2842.\r\n* 6\\.
  Heading 2844 applies only to:\r\n  * (a) technetium (atomic No.43), promethium (atomic
  No.61), polonium (atomic No.84) and all elements with an atomic number greater than
  84;\r\n  * (b) natural or artificial radioactive isotopes (including those of the
  precious metals or of the base metals of Sections XIV and XV), whether or not mixed
  together;\r\n  * (c) compounds, inorganic or organic, of these elements or isotopes,
  whether or not chemically defined, whether or not mixed together;\r\n  * (d) alloys,
  dispersions (including cermets), ceramic products and mixtures containing these
  elements or isotopes or inorganic or organic compounds thereof and having a specific
  radioactivity exceeding 74 Bq/g (0.002Ci/g);\r\n  * (e) spent (irradiated) fuel
  elements (cartridges) of nuclear reactors;\r\n  * (f) radioactive residues whether
  or not usable.\r\n* The term 'isotope', for the purposes of this Note and of the
  wording of headings 2844 and 2845, refers to:\r\n  * - individual nuclides, excluding,
  however, those existing in nature in the monoisotopic state;\r\n  * - mixtures of
  isotopes of one and the same element, enriched in one or several of the said isotopes,
  that is, elements of which the natural isotopic composition has been artificially
  modified.\r\n* 7\\. Heading 2848 includes copper phosphide (phosphor copper) containing
  more than 15% by weight of phosphorus.\r\n* 8\\. Chemical elements (for example,
  silicon and selenium) doped for use in electronics are to be classified in this
  Chapter, provided that they are in forms unworked as drawn, or in the form of cylinders
  or rods. When cut in the form of discs, wafers or similar forms, they fall in heading
  3818.\r\n\r\n## Additional note ##\r\n\r\n* 1\\. Unless provided otherwise, the
  salts specified in subheadings include acid salts and basic salts.\r\n"
