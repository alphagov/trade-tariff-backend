  (b) medicaments of heading 3003 or 3004; or
  (c) mixed unsaturated hydrocarbons of heading 3301, 3302 or 3805.
  2. References in heading 2710 to `petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals' include not only petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals but also similar oils, as well as those consisting mainly of mixed unsaturated hydrocarbons, obtained by any process, provided that the weight of the non-aromatic constituents exceeds that of the aromatic constituents. However, the references do not include liquid synthetic polyolefins of which less than 60% by volume distils at 300° C, after conversion to 1,013 millibars when a reduced-pressure distillation method is used (Chapter 39).

      (a) such oils no longer fit for use as primary products (for example, used lubricating oils, used hydraulic oils and used transformer oils);
      (b) sludge oils from the storage tanks of petroleum oils, mainly containing such oils and a high concentration of additives (for example, chemicals) used in the manufacture of the primary products; and
      (c) such oils in the form of emulsions in water or mixtures with water, such as those resulting from oil spills, storage tank washings, or from the use of cutting oils for machining operations.
