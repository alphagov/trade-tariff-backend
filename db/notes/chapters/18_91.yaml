:content: "* 1\\. This chapter does not cover:\r\n   * (a) clock or watch glasses
  or weights (classified according to their constituent material);\r\n   * (b) watch
  chains (heading 7113 or 7117, as the case may be);\r\n   * (c) parts of general
  use defined in note 2 to Section XV, of base metal (Section XV), or similar goods
  of plastics (Chapter 39) or of precious metal or metal clad with precious metal
  (generally heading 7115); clock or watch springs are, however, to be classified
  as clock or watch parts (heading 9114);\r\n   * (d) bearing balls (heading 7326
  or 8482, as the case may be);\r\n   * (e) articles of heading 8412 constructed to
  work without an escapement;\r\n   * (f) ball bearings (heading 8482); or\r\n   *
  (g) articles of Chapter 85, not yet assembled together or with other components
  into watch or clock movements or into articles suitable for use solely or principally
  as parts of such movements (Chapter 85).\r\n* 2\\. Heading 9101 covers only watches
  with case wholly of precious metal or of metal clad with precious metal, or of the
  same materials combined with natural or cultured pearls, or precious or semi-precious
  stones (natural, synthetic or reconstructed) of headings 7101 to 7104. Watches with
  case of base metal inlaid with precious metal fall in heading 9102.\r\n* 3\\. For
  the purposes of this chapter, the expression 'watch movements' means devices regulated
  by a balance-wheel and hairspring, quartz crystal or any other system capable of
  determining intervals of time, with a display or a system to which a mechanical
  display can be incorporated. Such watch movements shall not exceed 12mm in thickness
  and 50mm in width, length or diameter.\r\n* 4\\. Except as provided in note 1, movements
  and other parts suitable for use both in clocks or watches and in other articles
  (for example, precision instruments) are to be classified in this chapter."
