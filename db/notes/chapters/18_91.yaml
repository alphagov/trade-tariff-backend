  1. This chapter does not cover:
      (a) clock or watch glasses or weights (classified according to their constituent material);
      (b) watch chains (heading 7113 or 7117, as the case may be);
      (c) parts of general use defined in note 2 to Section XV, of base metal (Section XV), or similar goods of plastics (Chapter 39) or of precious metal or metal clad with precious metal (generally heading 7115); clock or watch springs are, however, to be classified as clock or watch parts (heading 9114);

      (e) articles of heading 8412 constructed to work without an escapement;
      (f) ball bearings (heading 8482); or
      (g) articles of Chapter 85, not yet assembled together or with other components into watch or clock movements or into articles suitable for use solely or principally as parts of such movements (Chapter 85).

  2. Heading 9101 covers only watches with case wholly of precious metal or of metal clad with precious metal, or of the same materials combined with natural or cultured pearls, or precious or semi-precious stones (natural, synthetic or reconstructed) of headings 7101 to 7104. Watches with case of base metal inlaid with precious metal fall in heading 9102.
  3. For the purposes of this chapter, the expression `watch movements' means devices regulated by a balance-wheel and hairspring, quartz crystal or any other system capable of determining intervals of time, with a display or a system to which a mechanical display can be incorporated.  Such watch movements shall not exceed 12mm in thickness and 50mm in width, length or diameter.
  4. Except as provided in note 1, movements and other parts suitable for use both in clocks or watches and in other articles (for example, precision instruments) are to be classified in this chapter.
