  1\\. For the purposes of subheadings 6402 12, 6402 19,\r\n6403 12, 6403 19 and 6404
  11, the expression 'sports footwear' applies only to:\r\n  * (a) footwear which

  of, spikes, sprigs, stops, clips, bars or the like;\r\n  * (b) skating boots, ski-boots
  and cross-country ski footwear, snowboard boots, wrestling boots, boxing boots and
  cycling shoes.\r\n\r\n## Additional notes ##\r\n\r\n* 1\\. Within the meaning of
  Note 4 (a), 'reinforcements' is taken to mean all pieces of material (for example,
  plastics or leather) attached to the external surface of the upper to give additional
  strength, whether or not also attached to the sole. After the removal of reinforcements,
  the visible material must have the characteristics of an upper and not lining, supporting
  the foot sufficiently to enable the wearer, with the original fastening systems
  in place, to walk in the footwear.\r\n*  Account is to be taken of sections covered
  by accessories or reinforcements when deciding on the composition of the upper.\r\n*
  2\\. Within the meaning of note 4 (b), one or more layers of textile material which
  do not possess the characteristics usually required for normal use of an outer sole
  (for example, durability, strength, etc.) are not to be taken into consideration
  for classification purposes."
