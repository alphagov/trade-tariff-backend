:content: "* 1\\. In this chapter, the following expressions have the meanings hereby
  assigned to them:\r\n  * (a) Bars and rods:\r\n    * Rolled, extruded, drawn or
  forged products, not in coils, which have a uniform solid cross-section along their
  whole length in the shape of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral
  triangles or regular convex polygons (including 'flattened circles' and 'modified
  rectangles', of which two opposite sides are convex arcs, the other two sides being
  straight, of equal length and parallel). Products with a rectangular (including
  square), triangular or polygonal cross-section may have corners rounded along their
  whole length. The thickness of such products which have a rectangular (including
  'modified rectangular') cross-section exceeds one-tenth of the width. The expression
  also covers cast or sintered products, of the same forms and dimensions, which have
  been subsequently worked after production (otherwise than by simple trimming or
  de-scaling), provided that they have not thereby assumed the character of articles
  or products of other headings.\r\n* (b) Profiles:\r\n    * Rolled, extruded, drawn,
  forged or formed products, coiled or not, of a uniform cross-section along their
  whole length, which do not conform to any of the definitions of bars, rods, wire,
  plates, sheets, strip, foil, tubes or pipes. The expression also covers cast or
  sintered products, of the same forms, which have been subsequently worked after
  production (otherwise than by simple trimming or de-scaling), provided that they
  have not thereby assumed the character of articles or products of other headings.\r\n
  \ * (c) Wire:\r\n    * Rolled, extruded or drawn products, in coils, which have
  a uniform solid cross-section along their whole length in the shape of circles,
  ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons
  (including 'flattened circles' and 'modified rectangles', of which two opposite
  sides are convex arcs, the other two sides being straight, of equal length and parallel).
  Products with a rectangular (including square), triangular or polygonal cross-section
  may have corners rounded along their whole length. The thickness of such products
  which have a rectangular (including 'modified rectangular') cross-section exceeds
  one-tenth of the width.\r\n  * (d) Plates, sheets, strip and foil:\r\n    * Flat-surfaced
  products (other than the unwrought products of heading 7901), coiled or not, of
  solid rectangular (other than square) cross-section with or without rounded corners
  (including 'modified rectangles' of which two opposite sides are convex arcs, the
  other two sides being straight, of equal length and parallel) of a uniform thickness,
  which are:\r\n      * \\- of rectangular (including square) shape with a thickness
  not exceeding one-tenth of the width,\r\n      * \\- of a shape other than rectangular
  or square, of any size, provided that they do not assume the character of articles
  or products of other headings.\r\n    * Heading 7905 applies, _inter alia_, to plates,
  sheets, strip and foil with patterns (for example, grooves, ribs, chequers, tears,
  buttons, lozenges) and to such products which have been perforated, corrugated,
  polished or coated, provided that they do not thereby assume the character of articles
  or products of other headings.\r\n  * (e) Tubes and pipes:\r\n    * Hollow products,
  coiled or not, which have a uniform cross-section with only one enclosed void along
  their whole length in the shape of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares),
  equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons, and which have a uniform wall
  thickness. Products with a rectangular (including square), equilateral triangular
  or regular convex polygonal cross-section, which may have corners rounded along
  their whole length, are also to be considered as tubes and pipes provided the inner
  and outer cross-sections are concentric and have the same form and orientation.
  Tubes and pipes of the foregoing cross-sections may be polished, coated, bent, threaded,
  drilled, waisted, expanded, cone-shaped or fitted with flanges, collars or rings.\r\n\r\n##
  Subheading note ##\r\n\r\n* 1\\. In this chapter, the following expressions have
  the meanings hereby assigned to them:\r\n  * (a) Zinc, not alloyed:\r\n    * Metal
  containing by weight at least 97.5% of zinc.\r\n  * (b) Zinc alloys:\r\n    * Metallic
  substances in which zinc predominates by weight over each of the other elements,
  provided that the total content by weight of such other elements exceeds 2.5%.\r\n
  \   * (c) Zinc dust:\r\n  * Dust obtained by condensation of zinc vapour, consisting
  of spherical particles which are finer than zinc powders. At least 80% by weight
  of the particles pass through a sieve with 63 micrometres (microns) mesh. It must
  contain at least 85% by weight of metallic zinc."
