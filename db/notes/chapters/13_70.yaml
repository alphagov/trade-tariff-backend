  1. This chapter does not cover:
      (a) goods of heading 3207 (for example, vitrifiable enamels and glazes, glass frit, other glass in the form of powder, granules or flakes);
      (b) articles of Chapter 71 (for example, imitation jewellery);
      (c) optical fibre cables of heading 8544, electrical insulators (heading 8546) or fittings of insulating material of heading 8547;
      (d) optical fibres, optically worked optical elements, hypodermic syringes, artificial eyes, thermometers, barometers, hydrometers or other articles of Chapter 90;
      (e) lamps or lighting fittings, illuminated signs, illuminated nameplates or the like, having a permanently fixed light source, or parts thereof of heading 9405;
      (f) toys, games, sports requisites, Christmas tree ornaments or other articles of Chapter 95 (excluding glass eyes without mechanisms for dolls or for other articles of Chapter 95); or
      (g) buttons, fitted vacuum flasks, scent or similar sprays or other articles of Chapter 96.

  2. For the purposes of headings 7003, 7004 and 7005:
      (a) glass is not regarded as `worked' by reason of any process it has undergone before annealing;
      (b) cutting to shape does not affect the classification of glass in sheets;
      (c) the expression `absorbent, reflecting or non-reflecting layer' means a microscopically thin coating of metal or of a chemical compound (for example, metal oxide) which absorbs, for example, infra-red light or improves the reflecting qualities of the glass while still allowing it to retain a degree of transparency or translucency; or which prevents light from being reflected on the surface of the glass.

  3. The products referred to in heading 7006 remain classified in that heading, whether or not they have the character of articles.
  4. For the purposes of heading 7019, the expression `glass wool' means:
      (a) mineral wools with a silica (SiO2) content not less than 60% by weight;
      (b) mineral wools with a silica (SiO2) content less than 60% but with an alkaline oxide (K2O or Na2O) content exceeding 5% by weight or a boric oxide (B2O3) content exceeding 2% by weight.
       Mineral wools which do not comply with the above specifications fall in heading 6806.
  (a) mineral wools with a silica (SiO2) content not less than 60% by weight;
  (b) mineral wools with a silica (SiO2) content less than 60% but with an alkaline oxide (K2O or Na2O) content exceeding 5% by weight or a boric oxide (B2O3) content exceeding 2% by weight.
  Mineral wools which do not comply with the above specifications fall in heading 6806.
  5. Throughout the nomenclature, the expression `glass' includes fused quartz and other fused silica.
  1. For the purposes of subheadings 7013 22, 7013 33, 7013 41 and 7013 91, the expression `lead crystal' means only glass having a minimum lead monoxide (PbO) content by weight of 24%.
