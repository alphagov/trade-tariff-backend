:content: "* 1\\. This chapter does not cover:\r\n  * (a) goods of heading 3207 (for
  example, vitrifiable enamels and glazes, glass frit, other glass in the form of
  powder, granules or flakes);\r\n  * (b) articles of Chapter 71 (for example, imitation
  jewellery);\r\n  * (c) optical fibre cables of heading 8544, electrical insulators
  (heading 8546) or fittings of insulating material of heading 8547;\r\n  * (d) optical
  fibres, optically worked optical elements, hypodermic syringes, artificial eyes,
  thermometers, barometers, hydrometers or other articles of Chapter 90;\r\n  * (e)
  lamps or lighting fittings, illuminated signs, illuminated nameplates or the like,
  having a permanently fixed light source, or parts thereof of heading 9405;\r\n  *
  (f) toys, games, sports requisites, Christmas tree ornaments or other articles of
  Chapter 95 (excluding glass eyes without mechanisms for dolls or for other articles
  of Chapter 95); or\r\n  * (g) buttons, fitted vacuum flasks, scent or similar sprays
  or other articles of Chapter 96.\r\n* 2\\. For the purposes of headings 7003, 7004
  and 7005:\r\n  * (a) glass is not regarded as 'worked' by reason of any process
  it has undergone before annealing;\r\n  * (b) cutting to shape does not affect the
  classification of glass in sheets;\r\n  * (c) the expression 'absorbent, reflecting
  or non-reflecting layer' means a microscopically thin coating of metal or of a chemical
  compound (for example, metal oxide) which absorbs, for example, infra-red light
  or improves the reflecting qualities of the glass while still allowing it to retain
  a degree of transparency or translucency; or which prevents light from being reflected
  on the surface of the glass.\r\n* 3\\. The products referred to in heading 7006
  remain classified in that heading, whether or not they have the character of articles.\r\n*
  4\\. For the purposes of heading 7019, the expression 'glass wool' means:\r\n  *
  (a) mineral wools with a silica (SiO2) content not less than 60% by weight;\r\n
  \ * (b) mineral wools with a silica (SiO2) content less than 60% but with an alkaline
  oxide (K2O or Na2O) content exceeding 5% by weight or a boric oxide (B2O3) content
  exceeding 2% by weight.\r\n  *  Mineral wools which do not comply with the above
  specifications fall in heading 6806.\r\n* 5\\. Throughout the nomenclature, the
  expression 'glass' includes fused quartz and other fused silica.\r\n\r\n## Subheading
  note ##\r\n\r\n  * 1. For the purposes of subheadings 7013 22, 7013 33, 7013 41
  and 7013 91, the expression 'lead crystal' means only glass having a minimum lead
  monoxide (PbO) content by weight of 24%."
