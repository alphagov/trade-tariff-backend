:content: "* 1\\. This chapter applies only to made up knitted or crocheted articles.\r\n*
  2\\. This chapter does not cover:\r\n  * (a) goods of heading 6212;\r\n  * (b) worn
  clothing or other worn articles of heading 6309; or\r\n  * (c) orthopaedic appliances,
  surgical belts, trusses or the like (heading 9021).\r\n* 3\\. For the purposes of
  headings 6103 and 6104:\r\n  * (a) the term 'suit' means a set of garments composed
  of two or three pieces made up, in respect of their outer surface, in identical
  fabric and comprising:\r\n    * \\- one suit coat or jacket the outer shell of which,
  exclusive of sleeves, consists of four or more panels, designed to cover the upper
  part of the body, possibly with a tailored waistcoat in addition whose front is
  made from the same fabric as the outer surface of the other components of the set
  and whose back is made from the same fabric as the lining of the suit coat or jacket;
  and\r\n    * \\- one garment designed to cover the lower part of the body and consisting
  of trousers, breeches or shorts (other than swimwear), a skirt or a divided skirt,
  having neither braces nor bibs.\r\n  * All of the components of a 'suit' must be
  of the same fabric construction, colour and composition; they must also be of the
  same style and of corresponding or compatible size. However, these components may
  have piping (a strip of fabric sewn into the seam) in a different fabric.\r\n  *
  If several separate components to cover the lower part of the body are presented
  together (for example, two pairs of trousers or trousers and shorts, or a skirt
  or divided skirt and trousers), the constituent lower part shall be one pair of
  trousers or, in the case of women's or girls' suits, the skirt or divided skirt,
  the other garments being considered separately.\r\n  * The term 'suit' includes
  the following sets of garments, whether or not they fulfil all the above conditions:\r\n
  \   * \\- morning dress, comprising a plain jacket (cutaway) with rounded tails
  hanging well down at the back and striped trousers;\r\n    * \\- evening dress (tailcoat),
  generally made of black fabric, the jacket of which is relatively short at the front,
  does not close and has narrow skirts cut in at the hips and hanging down behind;\r\n
  \   * \\- dinner jacket suits, in which the jacket is similar in style to an ordinary
  jacket (though perhaps revealing more of the shirt-front), but has shiny silk or
  imitation silk lapels.\r\n  * (b) The term 'ensemble' means a set of garments (other
  than suits and articles of heading 6107, 6108 or 6109), composed of several pieces
  made up in identical fabric, put up for retail sale, and comprising:\r\n    * \\-
  one garment designed to cover the upper part of the body, with the exception of
  pullovers which may form a second upper garment in the sole context of twin sets,
  and of waistcoats which may also form a second upper garment, and\r\n    * \\- one
  or two different garments, designed to cover the lower part of the body and consisting
  of trousers, bib and brace overalls, breeches, shorts (other than swimwear), a skirt
  or a divided skirt.\r\n  * All of the components of an ensemble must be of the same
  fabric construction, style, colour and composition; they also must be of corresponding
  or compatible size. The term 'ensemble' does not apply to track suits or ski suits,
  of heading 6112.\r\n* 4\\. Headings 6105 and 6106 do not cover garments with pockets
  below the waist, with a ribbed waistband or other means of tightening at the bottom
  of the garment, or garments having an average of less than 10 stitches per linear
  centimetre in each direction counted on an area measuring at least 10cm x 10cm.
  Heading 6105 does not cover sleeveless garments.\r\n* 5\\. Heading 6109 does not
  cover garments with a drawstring, ribbed waistband or other means of tightening
  at the bottom of the garment.\r\n* 6\\. For the purposes of heading 6111:\r\n  *
  (a) the expression 'babies garments and clothing accessories' means articles for
  young children of a body height not exceeding 86cm;\r\n  * (b) articles which are
  prima facie, classifiable both in heading 6111 and in other headings of this Chapter
  are to be classified in heading 6111.\r\n* 7\\. For the purposes of heading 6112
  'ski suits' means garments or sets of garments which, by their general appearance
  and texture, are identifiable as intended to be worn principally for skiing (cross
  country or alpine). They consist of either:\r\n  * (a) a 'ski overall', that is,
  a one piece garment designed to cover the upper and the lower parts of the body;
  in addition to sleeves and a collar, the ski overall may have pockets or footstraps;
  or\r\n  * (b) a 'ski ensemble', that is, a set of garments composed of two or three
  pieces, put up for retail sale and comprising:\r\n    * \\- one garment such as
  an anorak, windcheater, wind jacket or similar article, closed by a slide fastener
  (zipper), possibly with a waistcoat in addition, and\r\n    * \\- one pair of trousers,
  whether or not extending above waist-level, one pair of breeches or one bib and
  brace overall.\r\n  * The 'ski ensemble' may also consist of an overall similar
  to the one mentioned in paragraph (a) above and a type of padded sleeveless jacket
  worn over the overall.\r\n  * All the components of a 'ski ensemble' must be made
  up in a fabric of the same texture, style and composition whether or not of the
  same colour; they also must be of corresponding or compatible size.\r\n* 8\\. Garments
  which are, prima facie, classifiable both in heading 6113 and in other headings
  of this Chapter, excluding heading 6111, are to be classified in heading 6113.\r\n*
  9\\. Garments of this Chapter designed for left over right closure at the front
  shall be regarded as men's or boys' garments, and those designed for right over
  left closure at the front as women's or girls' garments. These provisions do not
  apply where the cut of the garment clearly indicates that it is designed for one
  or other of the sexes.\r\n  * Garments which cannot be identified as either men's
  or boys' garments or as women's or girls' garments are to be classified in the headings
  covering women's or girls' garments.\r\n* 10\\. Articles of this chapter may be
  made of metal thread.\r\n\r\n## Additional notes ##\r\n\r\n* 1\\. For the application
  of note 3 (b) to this chapter, the components of an ensemble must be made up entirely
  in a single identical fabric, subject to compliance with the other conditions laid
  down in the said note.\r\n* For this purpose:\r\n  * \\- the fabric used can be
  unbleached, bleached, dyed, of yarns of different colours or printed.\r\n  * \\-
  a pullover or waistcoat with ribbing is to be considered as a component of an ensemble,
  even if there is no ribbing on the component intended to cover the lower part of
  the body, provided that the ribbing is not sewn on but produced directly by the
  knitting process.\r\n* Sets of garments are not regarded as ensembles when their
  components are made up in different fabrics, even if the difference is due only
  to their respective colours.\r\n* All the components of an ensemble must be presented
  together for retail sale as a single unit. Individual wrapping or separate labelling
  of each component of such a single unit does not influence its classification as
  an ensemble.\r\n* 2\\. For the purposes of heading 6109, the terms 'singlets' and
  'other vests' include garments, even if of a fancy design, worn next to the body,
  without collar, with or without sleeves, including those with shoulder straps.\r\n*
  These garments, which are intended to cover the upper part of the body, often possess
  many characteristics in common with those of T-shirts or with more traditional kinds
  of singlets and other vests of heading 6109.\r\n* 3\\. Heading 6111 and subheadings
  6116 10 20 and 6116 10 80 cover gloves, mittens and mitts, impregnated, coated or
  covered with plastics or rubber, even if they are:\r\n  * \\- made up from knitted
  or crocheted textile fabrics impregnated, coated or covered with plastics or rubber
  of headings 5903 or 5906\r\n  * \\- or made up from unimpregnated, uncoated or uncovered
  knitted or crocheted textile fabrics and subsequently impregnated, coated or covered
  with plastics or rubber.\r\n* Where knitted or crocheted textile fabrics serve only
  as reinforcement, gloves, mittens or mitts impregnated, coated or covered with cellular
  plastics or cellular rubber belong in Chapters 39 or 40, even if they are made up
  from unimpregnated, uncoated or uncovered knitted or crocheted textile fabrics and
  subsequently impregnated, coated or covered with cellular plastics or cellular rubber
  (note 2(a)(5) and note 4 last paragraph to Chapter 59)."
