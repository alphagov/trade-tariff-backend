:content: "* 1\\. In this chapter, the following expressions have the meanings hereby
  assigned to them:\r\n    * (a) Bars and rods:\r\n      * Rolled, extruded, drawn
  or forged products, not in coils, which have a uniform solid cross-section along
  their whole length in the shape of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares),
  equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons (including 'flattened circles'
  and 'modified rectangles', of which two opposite sides are convex arcs, the other
  two sides being straight, of equal length and parallel). Products with a rectangular
  (including square), triangular or polygonal cross-section may have corners rounded
  along their whole length. The thickness of such products which have a rectangular
  (including 'modified rectangular') cross-section exceeds one-tenth of the width.
  The expression also covers cast or sintered products, of the same forms and dimensions,
  which have been subsequently worked after production (otherwise than by simple trimming
  or de-scaling), provided that they have not thereby assumed the character of articles
  or products of other headings.\r\n    * (b) Profiles:\r\n      * Rolled, extruded,
  drawn, forged or formed products, coiled or not, of a uniform cross-section along
  their whole length, which do not conform to any of the definitions of bars, rods,
  wire, plates, sheets, strip, foil, tubes or pipes. The expression also covers cast
  or sintered products, of the same forms, which have been subsequently worked after
  production (otherwise than by simple trimming or de-scaling), provided that they
  have not thereby assumed the character of articles or products of other headings.\r\n
  \   * (c) Wire:\r\n      * Rolled, extruded or drawn products, in coils, which have
  a uniform solid cross-section along their whole length in the shape of circles,
  ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons
  (including 'flattened circles' and 'modified rectangles', of which two opposite
  sides are convex arcs, the other two sides being straight, of equal length and parallel).
  Products with a rectangular (including square), triangular or polygonal cross-section
  may have corners rounded along their whole length. The thickness of such products
  which have a rectangular (including 'modified rectangular') cross-section exceeds
  one-tenth of the width.\r\n    * (d) Plates, sheets, strip and foil:\r\n      *
  Flat-surfaced products (other than the unwrought products of heading 7601), coiled
  or not, of solid rectangular (other than square) cross-section with or without rounded
  corners (including 'modified rectangles' of which two opposite sides are convex
  arcs, the other two sides being straight, of equal length and parallel) of a uniform
  thickness, which are:\r\n        * \\- of rectangular (including square) shape with
  a thickness not exceeding one-tenth of the width,\r\n        * \\- of a shape other
  than rectangular or square, of any size provided that they do not assume the character
  of articles or products of other headings.\r\n      * Headings 7606 and 7607 apply
  _inter alia_ to plates, sheets, strip and foil with patterns (for example, grooves,
  ribs, chequers, tears, buttons, lozenges) and to such products which have been perforated,
  corrugated, polished or coated, provided that they do not thereby assume the character
  of articles or products of other headings.\r\n    * (e) Tubes and pipes:\r\n    \t
  Hollow products, coiled or not, which have a uniform cross-section with only one
  enclosed void along their whole length in the shape of circles, ovals, rectangles
  (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons, and which
  have a uniform wall thickness. Products with a rectangular (including square), equilateral
  triangular or regular convex polygonal cross-section, which may have corners rounded
  along their whole length, are also to be considered as tubes and pipes provided
  the inner and outer cross-sections are concentric and have the same form and orientation.
  Tubes and pipes of the foregoing cross-sections may be polished, coated, bent, threaded,
  drilled, waisted, expanded, cone-shaped or fitted with flanges, collars or rings.\r\n\r\n##
  Subheading notes ##\r\n\r\n* 1\\. In this chapter, the following expressions have
  the meanings hereby assigned to them:\r\n  * (a) Aluminium, not alloyed:\r\n    *
  Metal containing by weight at least 99% of aluminium, provided that the content
  by weight of any other element does not exceed the limit specified in the following
  table:\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\">\r\n\t\t<thead>\r\n\t\t<tr><th
  colspan=\"2\">Other elements</th></tr>\r\n\t\t<tr><td colspan=\"2\"><hr class=\"thick\"></td></tr>\r\n\t\t<tr><td>Element</td><td>Limiting

  than 0.2%, provided that neither the chromium nor manganese content exceeds 0.05%</td></tr>\r\n\t\t<tr><td

  \ * (b) Aluminium alloys:\r\n    * Metallic substances in which aluminium predominates
  by weight over each of the other elements, provided that:\r\n      * (1) the content
  by weight of at least one of the other elements or of iron plus silicon taken together
  is greater than the limit specified in the foregoing table, or\r\n      * (2) the
  total content by weight of such other elements exceeds 1%.\r\n* 2\\. Notwithstanding
  the provisions of chapter note 1(c), for the purposes of subheading 7616 91 the
  term 'wire' applies only to products, whether or not in coils, of any cross-sectional
  shape, of which no cross-sectional dimension exceeds 6 mm."
