  2. Headings 8501 to 8504 do not apply to goods described in heading 8511, 8512, 8540, 8541 or 8542.
  However, metal tank mercury arc rectifiers remain classified in heading 8504.

  4. For the purposes of heading 8523:
      (a) `solid-state non-volatile storage devices' (for example, `flash memory cards' or `flash electronic storage cards')are storage devices with a connecting socket, comprising in the same housing one or more flash memories (for example, `Flash E2PROM') in the form of integrated circuits mounted on a printed circuit board. They may include a controller in the form of an integrated circuit and discrete passive components, such as capacitors and resistors;
      (b) the term `smart cards' means cards which have embedded in them one or more electronic integrated circuits (a microprocessor, random access memory (RAM) or read-only memory (ROM)) in the form of chips. These cards may contain contacts, a magnetic stripe or an embedded antenna but do not contain any other active or passive circuit elements.

These cards may contain contacts, a magnetic stripe or an embedded antenna but do not contain any other active or passive circuit elements.
  5. For the purposes of heading 8534, `printed circuits' are circuits obtained by forming on an insulating base, by any printing process (for example, embossing, plating-up, etching) or by the `film circuit' technique, conductor elements, contacts or other printed components (for example, inductances, resistors, capacitors) alone or interconnected according to a pre-established pattern, other than elements which can produce, rectify, modulate or amplify an electrical signal (for example, semiconductor elements).
  The expression `printed circuits' does not cover circuits combined with elements other than those obtained during the printing process, nor does it cover individual, discrete resistors, capacitors or inductances. Printed circuits may, however, be fitted with non-printed connecting elements.
  Thin- or thick-film circuits comprising passive and active elements obtained during the same technological process are to be classified in heading 8542.
  6. For the purpose of heading 8536, `connectors for optical fibres, optical fibre-bundles or cables' means connectors that simply mechanically align optical fibres end to end in a digital line system. They perform no other function, such as the amplification, regeneration or modification of a signal.
  7. Heading 8537 does not include cordless infrared devices for the remote control of televison receivers or other electrical equipment (heading 8543).
  8. For the purpose of headings 8541 and 8542:
      (a) `Diodes, transistors and similar semiconductor devices' are semiconductor devices the operation of which depends on variations in resistivity on the application of an electric field.
      (b) `Electronic integrated circuits' are:    (1) monolithic integrated circuits in which the circuit elements (diodes, transistors, resistors, capacitors, inductances, etc.) are created in the mass (essentially) and on the surface of a semiconductor or compound semiconductor material (for example doped silicon, gallium arsenide, silicon germanium, lndium phosphide) and are inseparably associated;    (2) hybrid integrated circuits in which passive elements (resistors, capacitors, inductances, etc), obtained by thin-or thick-film technology, and active elements (diodes, transistors, monolithic integrated circuits, etc.), obtained by semiconductor technology, are combined to all intents and purposes indivisibly, by interconnections or inter connecting cables, on a single insulating substrate (glass, ceramic, etc.). These circuits may also include discrete components;    (3) multichip integrated circuits consisting of two or more interconnected monolithic integrated circuits combined to all intents and purposes indivisibly, whether or not on one or more insulating substrates, with or without leadframes, but with no other active or passive circuit elements.     For the classification of the articles defined in this note, headings 8541 and 8542 shall take precedence over any other heading in the nomenclature, except in the case of heading 8523, which might cover them by reference to, in particular, their function.
  (a) `Diodes, transistors and similar semiconductor devices' are semiconductor devices the operation of which depends on variations in resistivity on the application of an electric field.

  1. Subheadings 8519 20 10, 8519 30 00 and 8519 89 11 are to be taken not to apply to sound reproducing apparatus with laser reading system.
  2. Subheading note 1 is applicable, mutatis mutandis, to subheadings 8519 81 15 and 8519 81 65.
