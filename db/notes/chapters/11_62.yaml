:chapter: 62
:content: "* 1\\. This chapter applies only to made-up articles of any textile fabric
  other than wadding, excluding knitted or crocheted articles (other than those of
  heading 6212).\r\n* 2\\. This chapter does not cover:\r\n  * (a) worn clothing or
  other worn articles of heading 6309; or\r\n  * (b) orthopaedic appliances, surgical
  belts, trusses or the like (heading 9021).\r\n* 3\\. For the purposes of headings
  6203 and 6204:\r\n  * (a) the term 'suit' means a set of garments composed of two
  or three pieces made up, in respect of their outer surface, in identical fabric
  and comprising:\r\n    * \\- one suit coat or jacket the outer shell of which, exclusive
  of sleeves, consists of four or more panels, designed to cover the upper part of
  the body, possibly with a tailored waistcoat in addition whose front is made from
  the same fabric as the outer surface of the other components of the set and whose
  back is made from the same fabric as the lining of the suit coat or jacket; and\r\n
  \   * \\- one garment designed to cover the lower part of the body and consisting
  of trousers, breeches or shorts (other than swimwear), a skirt or a divided skirt,
  having neither braces nor bibs.\r\n* All of the components of a 'suit' must be of
  the same fabric construction, colour and composition; they must also be of the same
  style and of corresponding or compatible size. However, these components may have
  piping (a strip of fabric sewn into the seam) in a different fabric.\r\n* If several
  separate components to cover the lower part of the body are presented together (for
  example, two pairs of trousers or trousers and shorts, or a skirt or divided skirt
  and trousers), the constituent lower part shall be one pair of trousers or, in the
  case of women's or girls' suits, the skirt or divided skirt, the other garments
  being considered separately.\r\n* The term 'suit' includes the following sets of
  garments, whether or not they fulfil all the above conditions:\r\n    * \\- morning
  dress, comprising a plain jacket (cutaway) with rounded tails hanging well down
  at the back and striped trousers;\r\n    * \\- evening dress (tailcoat), generally
  made of black fabric, the jacket of which is relatively short at the front, does
  not close and has narrow skirts cut in at the hips and hanging down behind;\r\n
  \   * \\- dinner jacket suits, in which the jacket is similar in style to an ordinary
  jacket (though perhaps revealing more of the shirt front), but has shiny silk or
  imitation silk lapels.\r\n  * (b) the term 'ensemble' means a set of garments (other
  than suits and articles of heading 6207 or 6208) composed of several pieces made
  up in identical fabric, put up for retail sale, and comprising:\r\n    * \\- one
  garment designed to cover the upper part of the body, with the exception of waistcoats
  which may also form a second upper garment, and\r\n    * \\- one or two different
  garments, designed to cover the lower part of the body and consisting of trousers,
  bib and brace overalls, breeches, shorts (other than swimwear), a skirt or a divided
  skirt.\r\n* All of the components of an ensemble must be of the same fabric construction,
  style, colour and composition; they also must be of corresponding or compatible
  size. The term 'ensemble' does not apply to track suits or ski suits, of heading
  6211.\r\n* 4\\. For the purposes of heading 6209:\r\n  * (a) the expression 'babies'
  garments and clothing accessories' means articles for young children of a body height
  not exceeding 86cm;\r\n  * (b) articles which are, prima facie, classifiable both
  in heading 6209 and in other headings of this chapter are to be classified in heading
  6209.\r\n* 5\\. Garments which are, prima facie, classifiable both in heading 6210
  and in other headings of this chapter, excluding heading 6209, are to be classified
  in heading 6210.\r\n* 6\\. For the purposes of heading 6211, 'ski suits' means garments
  or sets of garments which, by their general appearance and texture, are identifiable
  as intended to be worn principally for skiing (cross-country or alpine). They consist
  either of:\r\n  * (a) a 'ski overall', that is, a one-piece garment designed to
  cover the upper and the lower parts of the body; in addition to sleeves and a collar,
  the ski overall may have pockets or footstraps; or\r\n  * (b) a 'ski ensemble',
  that is, a set of garments composed of two or three pieces, put up for retail sale
  and comprising:\r\n    * \\- one garment such as an anorak, windcheater, wind-jacket
  or similar article, closed by a slide fastener (zipper), possibly with a waistcoat
  in addition, and\r\n    * \\- one pair of trousers, whether or not extending above
  waist-level, one pair of breeches or one bib and brace overall.\r\n* The 'ski ensemble'
  may also consist of an overall similar to the one mentioned in paragraph (a) above
  and a type of padded, sleeveless jacket worn over the overall.\r\n* All the components
  of a 'ski-ensemble' must be made up in a fabric of the same texture, style and composition,
  whether or not of the same colour; they also must be of corresponding or compatible
  size.\r\n* 7\\. Scarves and articles of the scarf type, square or approximately
  square, of which no side exceeds 60cm, are to be classified as handkerchiefs (heading
  6213). Handkerchiefs of which any side exceeds 60cm are to be classified in heading
  6214.\r\n* 8\\. Garments of this Chapter designed for left over right closure at
  the front shall be regarded as men's or boys' garments, and those designed for right
  over left closure at the front as women's or girls' garments. These provisions do
  not apply where the cut of the garment clearly indicates that it is designed for
  one or other of the sexes.\r\nGarments which cannot be identified as either men's
  or boys' garments or as women's or girls' garments are to be classified in the headings
  covering women's or girls' garments.\r\n* 9\\. Articles of this chapter may be made
  of metal thread.\r\n\r\n## Additional notes ##\r\n\r\n* 1\\. For the application
  note 3 (b) of this chapter, the components of an ensemble must be made up entirely
  in a single identical fabric, subject to compliance with the other conditions laid
  down in the said note.\r\n* For this purpose, the fabric used can be unbleached,
  bleached, dyed, of yarns of different colours or printed.\r\n* Sets of garments
  are not regarded as ensembles when their components are made up in different fabrics,
  even if the difference is due only to their respective colours.\r\n* All the components
  of an ensemble must be presented together for retail sale as a single unit. Individual
  wrapping or separate labelling of each component of such a single unit does not
  influence its classification as an ensemble.\r\n* 2\\. Headings 6209 and 6216 cover
  gloves, mittens and mitts, impregnated, coated or covered with plastics or rubber,
  even if they are:\r\n  * \\- made up from textile fabrics (other than knitted or
  crocheted) impregnated, coated or covered with plastics or rubber of headings 5903
  or 5906, or\r\n  * \\- made up from unimpregnated, uncoated or uncovered textile
  fabrics (other than knitted or crocheted) and subsequently impregnated, coated or
  covered with plastics or rubber.\r\n* Where textile fabrics (other than knitted
  or crocheted) serve only as reinforcement, gloves, mittens or mitts impregnated,
  coated or covered with cellular plastics or cellular rubber belong in Chapters 39
  or 40, even if they are made up from unimpregnated, uncoated or uncovered textile
  fabrics (other than knitted or crocheted) and subsequently impregnated, coated or
  covered with cellular plastics or cellular rubber (Note 2(a)(5) and note 4, last
  paragraph to Chapter 59)."
