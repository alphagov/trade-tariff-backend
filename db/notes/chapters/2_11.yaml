  from the milling of the cereals listed in the table below fall in this chapter if
  they have, by weight on the dry product:\r\n  * (a) a starch content (determined
  by the modified Ewers polarimetric method) exceeding that indicated in column 2;
  and\r\n  * (b) an ash content (after deduction of any added minerals) not exceeding
  that indicated in column 3.\r\n  * Otherwise, they fall in heading 2302.\r\n  *
  _However, germ of cereals, whole, rolled, flaked or ground, is always classified
  in heading 1104._\r\n  * (B). Products falling in this chapter under the above provisions
  shall be classified in heading 1101 or 1102 if the percentage passing through a
  woven metal wire cloth sieve with the aperture indicated in Column 4 or 5 is not
  less, by weight, than that shown against the cereal concerned.\r\nOtherwise, they
  fall in heading 1103 or 1104.\r\n* 3\\. For the purposes of heading 1103, the terms
  'groats' and 'meal' mean products obtained by the fragmentation of cereal grains,
  of which:\r\n  * (a) in the case of maize (corn) products, at least 95% by weight
  passes through a woven metal wire cloth sieve with an aperture of 2mm;\r\n  * (b)
  in the case of other cereal products, at least 95% by weight passes through a woven
  metal wire cloth sieve with an aperture of 1.25mm.\r\n\r\n## Additional notes ##\r\n\r\n*
  1\\. The duty rate applicable to mixtures of this chapter shall be as follows:\r\n
  \ * (a) in mixtures where one of the components represents at least 90% by weight,
  the rate applicable to that component applies.\r\n  * (b) in other mixtures, the
  rate applicable shall be that of the component which results in the highest amount
  of import duty.\r\n* 2\\. For the purposes of heading 1106, the terms 'flour', 'meal',
  and 'powder' mean products (other than shredded desiccated coconut), obtained by
  milling or some other fragmentation process from dried leguminous vegetables of
  heading 0713, from sago or roots or tubers of heading 0714 or from products of Chapter
  8, of which:\r\n  * (a) in the case of dried leguminous vegetables, sago, roots,
  tubers and products of Chapter 8 (excluding nuts of headings 0801 and 0802), at
  least 95% by weight passes through a woven metal wire cloth sieve with an aperture
  of 2 mm;\r\n  * (b) in the case of nuts of headings 0801 and 0802 at least 50% by
  weight passes through a woven metal wire cloth sieve with an aperture of 2.5 mm."
