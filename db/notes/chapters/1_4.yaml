  skimmed milk.\r\n* 2\\. For the purposes of heading 0405:\r\n  * (a) The term 'butter'
  means natural butter, whey butter or recombined butter (fresh, salted or rancid,
  including canned butter) derived exclusively from milk, with a milkfat content of
  80% or more but not more than 95% by weight, a maximum milk solids-not-fat content
  of 2% by weight and a maximum water content of 16% by weight. Butter does not contain
  added emulsifiers, but may contain sodium chloride, food colours, neutralising salts
  and cultures of harmless lactic-acid-producing bacteria.\r\n  * (b) The expression
  'dairy spreads' means a spreadable emulsion of the water-in-oil type, containing
  milkfat as the only fat in the product, with a milkfat content of 39% or more but
  less than 80% by weight.\r\n* 3\\. Products obtained by the concentration of whey
  and with the addition of milk or milkfat are to be classified as cheese in heading
  0406 provided that they have the three following characteristics:\r\n  * (a) a milkfat
  content, by weight of the dry matter, of 5% or more;\r\n  * (b) a dry matter content,
  by weight, of at least 70% but not exceeding 85%; and\r\n  * (c) they are moulded
  or capable of being moulded.\r\n* 4\\. This chapter does not cover:\r\n  * (a) products
  obtained from whey, containing by weight more than 95% lactose, expressed as anhydrous
  lactose calculated on the dry matter (heading 1702); or\r\n  * (b) albumins (including
  concentrates of two or more whey proteins, containing by weight more than 80% whey
  proteins, calculated on the dry matter) (heading 3502) or globulins (heading 3504)\r\n*
  5\\. For the purposes of subheading 0404 10, the expression 'modified whey' means
  products consisting of whey constituents, i.e. whey from which all or part of the
  lactose, proteins or minerals have been removed, whey to which natural whey constituents
  have been added, and products obtained by mixing natural whey constituents.\r\n*
  6\\. For the purposes of subheading 0405 10 the term 'butter' does not include dehydrated
  butter or ghee (subheading 0405 90).\r\n* 7\\. The duty rate applicable to mixtures
  falling in headings 0401 to 0406 shall be as follows:\r\n  * (a) in mixtures where
  one of the components represents at least 90% by weight, the rate applicable to
  that component applies;\r\n  * (b) in other mixtures, the rate applicable shall
  be that of the component which results in the highest amount of import duty.\r\n\r\n##

  preserved also applies to egg yolks with limited amounts of salt (in general, an
  amount of up to around 12% by weight) or minor amounts of chemicals added for preservation
  purposes provided that both of the following conditions are fulfilled:\r\n  *  (i)
  the products retain the character of egg yolks of subheadings 0408 11 and 0408 19;\r\n
