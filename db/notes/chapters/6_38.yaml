:content: "* 1\\. This chapter does not cover:\r\n  * (a) separate chemically defined
  elements or compounds with the exception of the following:\r\n    * (1) artificial
  graphite (heading 3801);\r\n    * (2) insecticides, rodenticides, fungicides, herbicides,
  anti-sprouting products and plant-growth regulators, disinfectants and similar products,
  put up as described in heading 3808;\r\n    * (3) products put up as charges for
  fire-extinguishers or put up in fire-extinguishing grenades (heading 3813);\r\n
  \   * (4) certified reference materials specified in note 2 below;\r\n    * (5)
  products specified in note 3(a) or 3(c) below;\r\n  * (b) mixtures of chemicals
  with foodstuffs or other substances with nutritive value, of a kind used in the
  preparation of human foodstuffs (generally, heading 2106).\r\n  * (c) slag, ash
  and residues (including sludges, other than sewage sludge), containing metals, arsenic
  or their mixtures and meeting the requirements of note 3 (a) or 3(b) to Chapter
  26 (heading 2620);\r\n  * (d) medicaments (heading 3003 or 3004); or\r\n  * (e)
  spent catalysts of a kind used for the extraction of base metals or for the manufacture
  of chemical compounds of base metals (heading 2620), spent catalysts of a kind used
  principally for the recovery of precious metal (heading 7112) or catalysts consisting
  of metals or metal alloys in the form of, for example, finely divided powder or
  woven guaze (Section XIV or XV).\r\n* 2\\. (A) For the purpose of heading 3822,
  the expression 'certified reference materials' means reference materials which are
  accompanied by a certificate which indicates the values of the certified properties,
  the methods used to determine these values and the degree of certainty associated
  with each value and which are suitable for analytical, calibrating or referencing
  purposes.\r\n* (B) With the exception of the products of Chapter 28 or 29, for the
  classification of certified reference materials, heading 3822 shall take precedence
  over any other heading in the nomenclature.\r\n* 3\\. Heading 3824 includes the
  following goods which are not to be classified in any other heading of the nomenclature:\r\n
  \ * (a) cultured crystals (other than optical elements) weighing not less than 2.5g
  each, of magnesium oxide or of the halides of the alkali or alkaline-earth metals;\r\n
  \ * (b) fusel oil; Dippel's oil;\r\n  * (c) ink removers put up in packings for
  retail sale;\r\n  * (d) stencil correctors, other correcting fluids and correction
  tapes (other than those of heading 9612), put up in packings for retail sale; and\r\n
  \ * (e) ceramic firing testers, fusible (eg, Seger cones).\r\n* 4\\. Throughout
  the nomenclature, 'municipal waste' means waste of a kind collected from households,
  hotels, restaurants, hospitals, shops, offices, etc., road and pavement sweepings,
  as well as construction and demolition waste. Municipal waste generally contains
  a large variety of materials such as plastics, rubber, wood, paper, textiles, glass,
  metals, food materials, broken furniture and other damaged or discarded articles.
  The term 'municipal waste', however, does not cover:\r\n  * (a) individual materials
  or articles segregated from the waste, such as wastes of plastics, rubber, wood,
  paper, textiles, glass or metals and spent batteries which fall in their appropriate
  headings of the nomenclature;\r\n  * (b) industrial waste;\r\n  * (c) waste pharmaceuticals,
  as defined in note 4(k) to Chapter 30; or\r\n  * (d) clinical waste, as defined
  in note 6 (a) below.\r\n* 5\\. For the purposes of heading 3825, 'sewage sludge'
  means sludge arising from urban effluent treatment plant and includes pretreatment
  waste, scourings and unstabilised sludge. Stabilised sludge when suitable for use
  as fertiliser is excluded (Chapter 31).\r\n* 6\\. For the purposes of heading 3825,
  the expression 'other wastes' applies to:\r\n  * (a) clinical waste, that is, contaminated
  waste arising from medical research, diagnosis, treatment or other medical, surgical,
  dental or veterinary procedures, which often contain pathogens and pharmaceutical
  substances and require special disposal procedures (eg, soiled dressings, used gloves
  and used syringes);\r\n  * (b) waste organic solvents;\r\n  * (c) wastes of metal
  pickling liquors, hydraulic fluids, brake fluids and anti-freezing fluids; and\r\n
  \ * (d) other wastes from chemical or allied industries.\r\n* The expression 'other
  wastes' does not, however, cover wastes which contain mainly petroleum oils or oils
  obtained from bituminous minerals (heading 2710).\r\n\r\n## Subheading notes ##\r\n\r\n*

  (ISO) and thiram (ISO).\r\n* 2\\. For the purposes of subheadings 3825 41 and 3825
  49, 'waste organic solvents' are wastes containing mainly organic solvents, not
  fit for further use as presented as primary products, whether or not intended for
  recovery of the solvents."
