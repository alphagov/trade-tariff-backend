  2. (A) For the purpose of heading 3822, the expression `certified reference materials' means reference materials which are accompanied by a certificate which indicates the values of the certified properties, the methods used to determine these values and the degree of certainty associated with each value and which are suitable for analytical, calibrating or referencing purposes.
      (B) With the exception of the products of Chapter 28 or 29, for the classification of certified reference materials, heading 3822 shall take precedence over any other heading in the nomenclature.
  (B) With the exception of the products of Chapter 28 or 29, for the classification of certified reference materials, heading 3822 shall take precedence over any other heading in the nomenclature.
  3. Heading 3824 includes the following goods which are not to be classified in any other heading of the nomenclature:
      (a) cultured crystals (other than optical elements) weighing not less than 2.5g each, of magnesium oxide or of the halides of the alkali or alkaline-earth metals;
      (b) fusel oil; Dippel's oil;
      (c) ink removers put up in packings for retail sale;
      (d) stencil correctors, other correcting fluids and correction tapes (other than those of heading 9612), put up in packings for retail sale; and

  4. Throughout the nomenclature, `municipal waste' means waste of a kind collected from households, hotels, restaurants, hospitals, shops, offices, etc., road and pavement sweepings, as well as construction and demolition waste. Municipal waste generally contains a large variety of materials such as plastics, rubber, wood, paper, textiles, glass, metals, food materials, broken furniture and other damaged or discarded articles. The term `municipal waste', however, does not cover:
      (a) individual materials or articles segregated from the waste, such as wastes of plastics, rubber, wood, paper, textiles, glass or metals and spent batteries which fall in their appropriate headings of the nomenclature;
      (b) industrial waste;
      (c) waste pharmaceuticals, as defined in note 4(k) to Chapter 30; or
      (d) clinical waste, as defined in note 6 (a) below.

  (c) waste pharmaceuticals, as defined in note 4(k) to Chapter 30; or
  (d) clinical waste, as defined in note 6 (a) below.
  5. For the purposes of heading 3825, `sewage sludge' means sludge arising from urban effluent treatment plant and includes pretreatment waste, scourings and unstabilised sludge. Stabilised sludge when suitable for use as fertiliser is excluded (Chapter 31).
  6. For the purposes of heading 3825, the expression `other wastes' applies to:
      (a) clinical waste, that is, contaminated waste arising from medical research, diagnosis, treatment or other medical, surgical, dental or veterinary procedures, which often contain pathogens and pharmaceutical substances and require special disposal procedures (eg, soiled dressings, used gloves and used syringes);
      (b) waste organic solvents;
      (c) wastes of metal pickling liquors, hydraulic fluids, brake fluids and anti-freezing fluids; and
      (d) other wastes from chemical or allied industries.

  (b) waste organic solvents;
  (c) wastes of metal pickling liquors, hydraulic fluids, brake fluids and anti-freezing fluids; and

  Subheading 3808 50 also covers dustable powder formulations containing a mixture of benomyl (ISO), carbofuran (ISO) and thiram (ISO).
