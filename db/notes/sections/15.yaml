:section: 15
:content: "* 1\\. This section does not cover:\r\n  * (a) prepared paints, inks or
  other products with a basis of metallic flakes or powder (headings 3207 to 3210,
  3212, 3213 or 3215);\r\n  * (b) ferro-cerium or other pyrophoric alloys (heading
  3606);\r\n  * (c) headgear or parts thereof of heading 6506 or 6507;\r\n  * (d)
  umbrella frames or other articles of heading 6603;\r\n  * (e) goods of Chapter 71
  (for example, precious-metal alloys, base metal clad with precious metal, imitation
  jewellery);\r\n  * (f) articles of Section XVI (machinery, mechanical appliances
  and electrical goods);\r\n  * (g) assembled railway or tramway track (heading 8608)
  or other articles of Section XVII (vehicles, ships and boats, aircraft);\r\n  *
  (h) instruments or apparatus of Section XVIII, including clock or watch springs;\r\n
  \ * (ij) lead shot prepared for ammunition (heading 9306) or other articles of Section
  XIX (arms and ammunition);\r\n  * (k) articles of Chapter 94 (for example, furniture,
  mattress supports, lamps and lighting fittings, illuminated signs, prefabricated
  buildings);\r\n  * (l) articles of Chapter 95 (for example, toys, games, sports
  requisites);\r\n  * (m) hand sieves, buttons, pens, pencil-holders, pen nibs or
  other articles of Chapter 96 (miscellaneous manufactured articles); or\r\n  * (n)
  articles of Chapter 97 (for example, works of art).\r\n* 2\\. Throughout the nomenclature,
  the expression 'parts of general use' means:\r\n  * (a) articles of heading 7307,
  7312, 7315, 7317 or 7318 and similar articles of other base metal;\r\n  * (b) springs
  and leaves for springs, of base metal, other than clock or watch springs (heading
  9114); and\r\n  * (c) articles of headings 8301, 8302, 8308, 8310 and frames and
  mirrors, of base metal, of heading 8306.\r\n* In Chapters 73 to 76 and 78 to 82
  (but not in heading 7315), references to parts of goods do not include references
  to parts of general use as defined above.\r\n* Subject to the preceding paragraph
  and to note 1 to Chapter 83, the articles of Chapter 82 or 83 are excluded from
  Chapters 72 to 76 and 78 to 81.\r\n* 3\\. Throughout the nomenclature, the expression
  'base metals' means: iron and steel, copper, nickel, aluminium, lead, zinc, tin,
  tungsten (wolfram), molybdenum, tantalum, magnesium, cobalt, bismuth, cadmium, titanium,
  zirconium, antimony, manganese, beryllium, chromium, germanium, vanadium, gallium,
  hafnium, indium, niobium (columbium), rhenium and thallium.\r\n* 4\\. Throughout
  the nomenclature, the term 'cermets' means products containing a microscopic heterogeneous
  combination of a metallic component and a ceramic component. The term 'cermets'
  includes sintered metal carbides (metal carbides sintered with a metal).\r\n* 5\\.
  Classification of alloys (other than ferro-alloys and master alloys as defined in
  Chapters 72 and 74):\r\n  * (a) An alloy of base metals is to be classified as an
  alloy of the metal which predominates by weight over each of the other metals.\r\n
  \ * (b) An alloy composed of base metals of this section and of elements not falling
  within this section is to be treated as an alloy of base metals of this section
  if the total weight of such metals equals or exceeds the total weight of the other
  elements present.\r\n  * (c) In this section, the term 'alloys' includes sintered
  mixtures of metal powders, heterogeneous intimate mixtures obtained by melting (other
  than cermets) and intermetallic compounds.\r\n* 6\\. Unless the context otherwise
  requires, any reference in the nomenclature to a base metal includes a reference
  to alloys which, by virtue of note 5 above, are to be classified as alloys of that
  metal.\r\n* 7\\. Classification of composite articles:\r\n* Except where the headings
  otherwise require, articles of base metal (including articles of mixed materials
  treated as articles of base metal under the Interpretative rules) containing two
  or more base metals are to be treated as articles of the base metal predominating
  by weight over each of the other metals.\r\n* For this purpose:\r\n  * (a) Iron
  and steel, or different kinds of iron or steel, are regarded as one and the same
  metal.\r\n  * (b) An alloy is regarded as being entirely composed of that metal
  as an alloy of which, by virtue of note 5, it is classified.\r\n  * (c) A cermet
  of heading 8113 is regarded as a single base metal.\r\n* 8\\. In this section, the
  following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them:\r\n  * (a) Waste
  and scrap\r\n  * Metal waste and scrap from the manufacture or mechanical working
  of metals, and metal goods definitely not usable as such because of breakage, cutting-up,
  wear or other reasons.\r\n  * (b) Powders\r\n  * Products of which 90% or more by
  weight passes through a sieve having a mesh aperture of 1mm.\r\n"
